My own original dialect of English, for example, is seen as a low-class variant of English. If I were to speak it to people, I might have to give her a job interview. I would be perceived very differently to how I'm perceived now, speaking standard northern English. Similar things happen in the US with African-American vernacular English where it will be perceived differently in different contexts. There are many, many different elements that come into this, the intersec between native speakers, speakers as a second language. People who are native level speakers with other community language and then they go through an English language education system and therefore have the native level ability. So there are so many layers to that idea that it becomes quite complicated. And I think possibly the people that fit into that category actually, the last one that I mentioned, you have a community language or a family language and you learn English because you go through the system and you speak it at school, you speak it outside, you speak to a native level, when they try and go out abroad because they speak a local language too, they even find it very difficult. I imagine sometimes even start doubting themselves and it's like, logically, there",
